Problem Type → Multi-class classification (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.).

Data → We use a labeled dataset of human faces with emotions. Common:

FER2013 (35k grayscale face images, 48x48, 7 emotions).

Alternatives: CK+, RAF-DB.

Preprocessing → Detect faces, resize to fixed size, normalize pixel values.

Model → CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or transfer learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet).

Evaluation → Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.

Deployment → Can integrate with OpenCV for real-time webcam detection.
